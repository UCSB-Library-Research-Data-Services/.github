## Welcome to the UCSB Research Data Services GitHub organization 👋

We use our GitHub organization to host repositories containing workshop materials on the above topics. Please feel free to look around and let us know if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on specific topics!!

**_[Research Data Services (RDS)](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/research-data-services)_ promotes open science practices and helps UCSB researchers manage and preserve their research data and associated code through consultations, long-term engagements, and instructional workshops**. Our team offers support across the research project lifecycle, from pre-project planning (e.g., DMP writing) to post-project archival, connecting researchers with both locally- and externally-provided curation services. Our goals are to ensure that researchers satisfy funder mandates, that research is transparent and reproducible, that research data is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), and that researchers receive scholarly credit for sharing and publishing their code and data.

Here are a few examples of services:
- Data management planning during the preparation of your future project, including helping with proposal data management plans.
- Day-to-day data management best practices
- Data preservation for publication and beyond
- Advise on how to make your lab more reproducible and collaborative
