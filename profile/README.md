## Welcome to the UCSB Research Data Services GitHub organization 👋

_[Research Data Services (RDS)](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/research-data-services)_ helps UC Santa Barbara researchers manage and preserve their research data through consultations, long-term engagements, and instructional workshops. 
Our team offers support across the research data lifecycle, from pre-project planning to post-project archival, connecting researchers with both locally- and externally-provided curation services. 
Our goal is to ensure that all research data is well-described, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), and sustainably preservable and that researchers receive scholarly credit for sharing and publishing data.

We offer the following services:
- Data management planning during the preparation of your future project, including helping with proposal data management plans.
- Data-to-day data management best practices
- Data preservation for publication and beyond
- Advise on how to make your lab more reproducible and collaborative
